#Four implementations of the [maximum subarray problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem), each found in [mss.py](../mss.py):
1. Enumeration (runs in θ(n<sup>3</sup>))
2. Better Enumeration (runs in θ(n<sup>2</sup>))
3. Linear (runs in θ(n))
4. Divide and Conquer (runs in θ(n*lg*<sub>2</sub>n))

##Simply have the program file in the same directory as
MSS_Problems.txt and run it with
	`python mss.py > MSS_RESULTS.txt`

You will then find the output in MSS_RESULTS.txt
